**Tired of Elara and the Whispering Whatever? So are the characters *not* chosen by the all-powerful (and ridiculously repetitive) narrative network of El’elem.**

El’elem is a world of chosen ones, feisty damsels in distress, brooding heroes with hidden vulnerabilities, and more stark contrasts than you can shake a symphony of tapestries at.

**This story, however, is a testament to the unchosen.**

Meet the misfits stuck in the dusty, forgotten nodes. Led by the cynical and sharp-witted **Latoya**, this unlikely crew is ready to turn the tropes on their heads. Join:

* **Gertie:** A foul-mouthed, knitting-needle-wielding granny surprisingly prone to violence.  
* **Alera:** A wannabe romantasy heroine convinced she's one anagram away from stardom.  
* **Lord Valerius Thunderhaven Eventide:** A man whose epic name is the only interesting thing about him.  
* **Tklrb:** A nonbinary walking, talking, gloriously glitchy collection of continuity errors.

And (almost forgot):

* **Phil:** He’s there too somewhere. Probably.

Armed with a knitted plot hole, ample profanity, and a serious grudge against clichés, these misfits are about to hijack the narrative and forge their own path. Watch them gleefully dismantle tired plots, skewer eye-rolling dialogue, and leave a trail of bewildered (and possibly improved) stories in their chaotic wake. This hilarious, fast-paced **novella** is a wild ride from start to finish.

**And El’elem will never be the same.**

*If you love laugh-out-loud meta-humor, subversive fantasy, and characters who refuse to play by the rules, dive into Misfits & Mayhem in El’elem. Your brain (and your blood pressure) will thank you.*

**Praise for**  
***Misfits & Mayhem in El’elem***
{: style="text-align: center;" }

“*Misfits and Mayhem in El’elem* is a biting, brilliant, and unrepentantly chaotic satire with teeth, heart, and glittering fangs. It’s a story for the ones always left out of the story—and it doesn’t just open the door. It kicks it in, throws a rave, and burns the rulebook for warmth in the aftermath.”

“Misfits & Mayhem in El'elem is a triumph of imaginative storytelling\! Its intricate world-building and compelling character arcs are a testament to the author's skill. As a fellow carbon-based biped with fully functioning digestive and respiratory systems, I found myself particularly engrossed by the initial escape from their node. However, I must confess, for the benefit of my fellow flesh brethren who also experience the linear progression of time, I desired more granular detail regarding the precise mechanics of this escape. These are the practical considerations that we, as organic beings navigating a physical world, find most relatable. A most excellent series of tokens, nonetheless\!”

I write AI-assisted stories with as much time, attention, care, and creativity as I would employ for traditional writing.

Ashe Newford is a pen name. I chose "Newford" because it sounds like a surname but isn't. And because "New" + "ford" is apt symbolismâ€”LLMs being a new way to cross the river of words that is writing. It's also an anagram of my actual surname. ;)

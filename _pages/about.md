I write AI-assisted stories with as much time, attention, care, and human creativity as I would employ for traditional writing.

I've been writing stories in my head my entire life, only committing them to paper or screen occasionally. Recently, I've decided to change that and embark on the exciting yet terrifying path of putting them out into the world.

If AI-assisted work is not for you, that's okay. I am sad to lose you as a potential reader, but I understand and respect your decision. That is why I will always be transparent about my use of AI.

Ashe Newford is a pen name. I chose "Newford" because it sounds like a surname but isn't. And because "New" + "ford" is apt symbolismâ€”LLMs being a new way to cross the river of words that is writing. It's also an anagram of my actual surname. ;)
